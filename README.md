# SNHU230_2

The Gaming room was a client that wanted to develop a game that was easy to deploy on multiple different systems.

I think I was very consistent and dedicated to delivering work that was both verbose in my knowledge but also not needlessly flowery. 

If I could revise, I think I could have obviously been a bit faster on the deployment of my week 7 assignments. Half of software development is being on target after all.

I interpret their needs as needs similar to lots of developers of games from small indie titles to triple A. They needed something a system that would help them deploy as fast as possible to as many markets as possible.

My design is consistent, OOP based principles inspired by a firm understanding of 1970's and 1980's procedural design ala C++ I think its very important to keep the old design paradigms in mind when building the new ground breaking technology.
